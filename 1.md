# Basic forms

## Very basic form
First this is a simple Hello world HTML page
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh" crossorigin="anonymous">

    <title>Hello, world!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <!-- Optional JavaScript -->
    <!-- jQuery first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS -->
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-J6qa4849blE2+poT4WnyKhv5vZF5SrPo0iEjwBvKU7imGFAV0wwj1yYfoRSJoZ+n" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-Q6E9RHvbIyZFJoft+2mJbHaEWldlvI9IOYy5n3zV9zzTtmI3UksdQRVvoxMfooAo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-wfSDF2E50Y2D1uUdj0O3uMBJnjuUD4Ih7YwaYd1iqfktj0Uod8GCExl3Og8ifwB6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now consider, we have to ask user to enter *Name*. We can add the following inside the *body* tag : 
```html
<form action="/endpoint" method="post">
    <label for="firstName">First Name</label>
    <input type="text" name="firstName" id="firstName">

    <label for="lastName">Last Name</label>
    <input type="text" name="lastName" id="lastName">

    <input type="submit" value="Save">
</form>
```
This would result in the follwing html. \
![Image of a form](./images/form.PNG)

The user can fill in the information and click on "Save" when done. 

> now, What happens when this button is pressed?\
The browser sends the form data to the endpoint specified in the `action` parameter of the form.

There are times when this behaviour is not enough, we might have to perform some sanity check before sending the data to the backend. Hence we can intercept this action of the browser sending data to the server using Javascript.\
For Eg. I need to alert the user with firstName,lastName What can be done is, we can add the following script tag after we load jQuery.
```javascript
<script>

    $(document).ready(function () {

      $("#firstForm").on('submit', function (e) {
        e.preventDefault(); //prevent submit

        //Access Form info
        myFormObject = new FormData(document.getElementById("firstForm")); 
        alert("you enetered " + 
        myFormObject.get('firstName') + ", " + 
        myFormObject.get('lastName'));
      });

    });

  </script>
```
Now since we know how to intercept the default behaviour of the form, we can use it to modify the form object to suit our needs, THEN send the POST / GET request via JavaScript.

# Basics of JavaScript
1. Controlling ASync function calls.\
* JS is single thereaded, blocking & Synchronous. It SUPPORTS async behaviour.(i.e. some functions are defined as async)
* It essentially has an execution stack and an event queue.
* Things are added to this execution stack, but messages can be left into the event queue in async way.
* The job of the Event loop is to look into the call stack and determine if the call stack is empty or not. If the call stack is empty, it looks into the message queue to see if thereâ€™s any pending callback waiting to be executed.
Unlike other languages, if 2 function calls are made after each other,
Function callback is a process of one function calling the other function once the first function is done it's job. We can use Callbacks or Promises to sync function calls. \\

Essentially, when we call an external API / make a DB call, it does not make sense for a language to keep the function on the top of the execution stack. Hence instead of keeping it in the top of the stack, we have the power to instruct browser engine / nodejs to put a message in the event queue once it is done fetching the DB or api call.


2. Promises\
Promises can be used to make async code synced. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40029867/trying-to-implement-a-simple-promise-in-reactjs) is a good answer for using Promises with ReactJS.

3. Variables, Functions & Es6 syntax.
varibles can be declared in various ways. You can use `var, let or const` keywords to declare a variable. They differ by the scope. `var` has function scope, `let` & `const` have block scope. As name might suggest a `const` creates immutable variables.

ES6 classes can be used to delcare classes in JS. You can have inheritance in ES6 classes. A good example for everything in these classes : [es6 class sample](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/classes-es6/)\

You can declare functions using the `arrow` syntax as well. These functions are same to the functions declared by using the `function` keyword.\
Eg: These are equavalent 
```javascript
// Function Expression
const doubleEXP = function(num){
  return num * 2;
}
// Arrow Function
const doubleARR = (num) => {
  return num * 2;
}
```

# Creating a Server

## Your first server.
 Let's create a server. Essentially follow [Expressjs Installation guide](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) & [Hello World Guide](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)

1. cd to a new folder
2. `npm init` to initialize a new NPM project.
3. Hit enter for everything.
4. run `npm install express --save` This will save expressjs as a depedency in your package.json file.
5. Create a file `index.js`

Enter hello world code there 
```javascript
const express = require('express') // IMPORT express
const app = express() // create an instance of the import.
const port = 3000 // variable to store the port to listen on

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!')) // IF you get a GET on '/' send 'Hello World' as a response'

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`)) // make app listen on the port.
```
You just created a simple Server. That returns Hello world when you ask '/'! 
Now you can use any of the clients to request this server.

Important highlights : 
* `app.get` => accepts 2 parameters. one the path of the request and other the function to run when the path string is received. In our case the path is root or '/' the function is defined in the `arrow` function format.
* `req,res` => the fuction is passed 2 arguments : `req` corresponds to the request. This object can be used to extract request parameters. `res` defines the modifyable object which will be given as a response. In our case, we are not looking for any vairebles from the request and just sending "Hello World!" as a response.

## Generating Entire skeleton of an app.
You can certainly add everyting, but in general an express app has typical skeleton, we can use generator to scaffold out basic functions. We will use `npx` for this.
1. cd to a new directory
2. run `npx express-generator --view-ejs` .This will scaffold an express app.
3. Observe the files.

`app.js` is the start point of the app. It contains basic code to parse requests and imports to indexRoutes and userRoutes. `index.js`(one of the controllers) in routes folder contains the code to be invoked when any request hits the server on root domain. An example flow is :
1. A client hits the "/" endpoint. 
2. The expressJS app parses the input and populates the request information in the `req` variable (1st argument) & a `res` variable(2nd argument). 
3. ExpressJS matches the endpoint to existing routes that any controller (or route ) can serve. 
4. If the match is found, that controller is invoked.
5. The function in this controller is responsible to populate the `res` object which was passed when calling the said function.
6. The response is hence sent to the user.

You can run this using command `npm install` followed by `DEBUG=myapp:* npm start` (unix) or `set DEBUG=myapp:* & npm start` (Windows). Checkout [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) & [http://localhost:3000/users](http://localhost:3000/users). The logic to be sent in the requests is written in the router defined in `index.js` and `users.js` respectfully. 

## Modifying one of the controllers.
### Hello **name**
We want the server to respond with `Hello <your Name>` when the server receives a POST request on `/hello` i.e. `http://localhost:3000/hello`. let's modify the index.js controller. 

```javascript
router.post('/hello', (req,res)=>{
  res.json({"Greeting" : "Hello " + req.body.name});
});
```
We can call this API from any of the clients. Here is a snip of the postman client. 

![Image of postman doing the request](./images/postman-hello.PNG)

We can also call these requests from a Javascript method in HTML file you created. We will use [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to do this job in ReactJS app. You can also use the Browser native or any other library to do the ajax call.

### Simple addition API
Consider a simple API where we want the server to give us the result of addition of 2 nos. 
> **Stop** and Think how you would implement this... 

One way is to add the following function in `index.js`:
```javascript
//note, unlike POST, parameters are visible to a user in browser address bar in GET request.
router.get('/add/:firstNumber/and/:secondNumber', (req,res)=>{
  console.log(req.params.firstNumber + req.params.secondNumber);
  //Checkout console to see why parseInt is essential in this case.
  let firstNo = parseInt(req.params.firstNumber),
      secondNo = parseInt(req.params.secondNumber);
  res.json({"Addition" : firstNo + secondNo});
});

```

We could have done this exactly the way we did the previous technique ( using POST request and `res.body`) but this is just another way to demo the `params` attribute. You can see basic routing info on [Express Docs- Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)
let's invoke this using other client: your browser. Visit [http://localhost:3000/add/1/and/2](http://localhost:3000/add/1/and/2). 

## Adding DB.
Follow ExpressJS [instructions](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html#mongodb) to add MongoDB.
you do not need to [install mongoDB locally](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) (if you have some storage limitations). You can just use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to get a free cloud hosted DB and use the internet to connect to that DB instead of the `localhost:27017` you use in the instructions in that case.

Just for reference you can use direct MongoDB queries off Express.
To Insert:
> db.users.insert( { name: "ninad", web : "https://ninadtech.com" } );

To find: 
> db.users.find({name : "ninad"});

To update:
> db.users.updateOne({name : "ninad" , $set: {"web" : "https://ninadpchaudhari.github.io"}})

You can find all the  basic operations on [MongoDB docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/) or just google about basic commands.
